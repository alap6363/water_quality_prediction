## How to Use

Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and preprocess it to handle any missing or inconsistent values.
Convert categorical variables into numerical format if needed.

Train the Model:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the GaussianNB classifier on the training set.

Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing set.
Evaluate Performance:

Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Interpret Results:

Analyze the model's predictions and gain insights into water quality classifications.
